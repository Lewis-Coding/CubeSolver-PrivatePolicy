            <h2>What local data does this app store on my device?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Small text files are used to the app's configuration, and are stored under the it's package name so that they are deleted automatically with the app</p>
            <p>The only files this app generates and stores on your device which are not created during the app's original installation, are small text files containing your preferred settings. For example, if you change the playback speed
                in the app's settings page, a file containing your new preferred value is created and stored under the app's package name. This is done so that when the app is closed and reopened, the setting can be reloaded. Furthermore, 
                because the files are stored under the apps package name, your phone will automatically delete them when the app is uninstalled.
